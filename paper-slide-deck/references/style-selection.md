# Style Selection

Read this file when choosing a visual style: from an explicit `--style <name>`, or by
auto-selecting from content signals. The full specification for each style lives in
`references/styles/<style>.md`.

> **Academic-signal caution**: When the content matches `academic-paper` signals (paper/thesis/neurips/cvpr/icml/…), this skill still bakes text into an image, so **equations, result tables, and exact numbers may be garbled**. Extract real figures/tables from the source PDF (`Source: extract`) rather than letting the model redraw them, and if the deck needs faithful, editable formulas/data, tell the user to use **scholar-slides** instead.
